Grep has some powerful options for complex matching:
 -e <pattern>   : use multiple times for match diff things
 -f <file>      : each line is treated as a pattern to use
 -v             : return NON-matching lines

population.txt    samples.txt
==============    ===========
apple             banana
banana            cherry
cherry            apple
donut

# find population missing from samples
grep     -v -f samples.txt population.txt
 --> donut

# show samples in context of population
grep -e "^" -f samples.txt population.txt
 --> apple    \
     banana    } these get "colored" red
     cherry   /
     donut
